# myVoteDapp
My VoteDapp is a voting app that allows an admin or registrar to create an election and also register the contestants in the election.
Voters who are eligible to vote can then register and vote for the particular candidate of their choice using the contestants ID and Election ID. as well as voter address.
To be eligible to vote, voter must be above 18 and must have the same constituency and state code as that of the contestants.
Starttimes and Endtimes for elections are implemented on the frontend ensuring that voting does not start before election start time nor can they be accesed after the election has ended. Also, Election results are only accessible after the elections have ended.
